# Asferro Project challenge

#i used NX workspace which helps to scale app as it grows

#install
npm install

#run the app
RUN 'npx nx run asffero:serve'

#run the api
RUN 'npx nx run asffero:api'

## ‚òÅ Notice

when you try to edit or delete user first add the user and try to edit or delete it ... why becuase i prevent editing the default data becuase if all data removed it will be hard to test
